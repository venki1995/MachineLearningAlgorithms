## Logistic Regression

1. Uses gradient descent for loss function optimisation
2. eta is the learning rate which is multiplied with the gradient and n_iterations is number of iterations 
3. The input feature vector X and target y are to be given as column vectors to the model

### Cost Function

Cost function is written only for 1 feature variable although the algorithm works for any number of features
