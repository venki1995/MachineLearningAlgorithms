# Machine Learning Algorithms for beginners

This repo contains ML algorithms that I practised in python for better understanding

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages numpy,matplotlib

```bash
pip install numpy,matplotlib
```

## Usage

## Linear Regression

1. Uses gradient descent for loss function optimisation with convergence of 0.001.
2. eta is the learning rate which is multiplied with the gradient and n_iterations is number of iterations 
3. The input feature vector X and target y are to be given as column vectors to the model
